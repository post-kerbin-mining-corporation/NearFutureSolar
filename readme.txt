NEAR FUTURE SOLAR PACK v0.7.2
=============================

This pack contains many modern and fancy solar panels to use on your ships and stations.

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required:
- ModuleManager (2.7.4)

Optional
- Community Tech Tree (v2.2+)

INSTALLATION
============

I recommend removing any previous versions of Near Future Solar before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

============
KSP-MINI-AVC
============

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent.
For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the KSP-AVC Plugin (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
