    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-deploying-1x3-1_description = As a follow up to the underwhelmingly popular 1x4 series, the K5X also includes concentrator lenses and sacrifices its ability to retract. The result is a panel that is quite light for its generation capabilities. Just don't sneeze on it.

    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-deploying-2x1-1_description = Disputing the Gigantor-XL's claim of 'single largest solar array available*', the Megalador is large and unwieldy - but, if you can get past all that, is packed with loads of advanced solar cells. Cannot be retracted.
